<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
I am a Data Analyst with a background in data science, experienced in
cleaning, integrating, and analyzing real-world datasets to uncover
meaningful insights. My work focuses on exploratory data analysis,
visualization, and translating complex data into clear, decision-relevant
findings.
</p>

<p>
I have experience working with multi-source economic, environmental,
and food security datasets, and I enjoy solving analytical problems
that sit at the intersection of data, policy, and business decisions.
</p>

<p>
I am actively seeking Data Analyst roles where data analysis and
visualization support informed decision-making.
