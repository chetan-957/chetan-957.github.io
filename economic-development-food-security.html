<h1>The Interplay Between Economic Development, Environmental Factors & Food Security</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
This project examines how economic development and environmental factors
interact to shape food security outcomes across countries over time.
By integrating multiple real-world datasets, the analysis explores
whether economic growth consistently translates into improved food
availability, and how environmental pressures complicate this relationship.
</p>

<h2>Datasets Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>FAOSTAT Food Balance Sheets (food supply & nutrition indicators)</li>
  <li>World Bank World Development Indicators (GDP, GNI, inequality)</li>
  <li>Environmental datasets (CO₂ and related emissions indicators)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Cleaning & Integration</h2>
<p>
The analysis required extensive preprocessing, including harmonizing
country identifiers, aligning time ranges across datasets, handling
missing values, and creating derived indicators at the country–year level.
Multiple datasets were merged into a unified analytical structure
to support cross-country and temporal comparisons.
</p>

<h2>Analysis & Visualization</h2>
<p>
Exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques were applied
to examine trends, correlations, and distributional differences across
income groups and regions. Visualizations were used to compare food
availability metrics against economic and environmental indicators,
highlighting structural patterns rather than isolated observations.
</p>

<h2>Key Insights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Economic development is associated with higher food availability,
      but the magnitude of improvement varies significantly across
      income groups and regions.</li>
  <li>Upper-middle-income countries showed stronger marginal gains in
      food availability compared to high-income countries, where
      improvements tended to plateau.</li>
  <li>Environmental indicators such as emissions reveal trade-offs,
      suggesting that improvements in food security are often accompanied
      by increased environmental pressure.</li>
  <li>High-income countries exhibit distinct food security and
      sustainability patterns, highlighting that economic growth alone
      does not guarantee environmentally balanced outcomes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This project demonstrates how combining economic, environmental, and
food system data provides a more nuanced understanding of global food
security challenges. The findings highlight the importance of evaluating
development outcomes through both social and environmental lenses when
assessing long-term sustainability.
