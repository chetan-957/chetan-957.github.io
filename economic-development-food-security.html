<h1>The Interplay Between Economic Development, Environmental Factors & Food Security</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
This project analyzes how economic development and environmental factors
interact with food security outcomes across countries over time.
Using multiple real-world datasets, the analysis explores relationships
between income levels, emissions, and food availability indicators.
</p>

<h2>Datasets Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>FAOSTAT Food Balance Sheets (food supply & nutrition indicators)</li>
  <li>World Bank World Development Indicators (GDP, GNI, inequality)</li>
  <li>Environmental datasets (CO₂ and related emissions indicators)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Cleaning & Integration</h2>
<p>
Multiple datasets were cleaned, standardized, and merged at the
country–year level. This included handling missing values,
harmonizing country names, aligning time ranges, and creating
derived indicators for analysis.
</p>

<h2>Analysis & Visualization</h2>
<p>
Exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques were applied
to examine trends, correlations, and cross-country differences.
Visualizations were used to highlight relationships between economic
growth, environmental pressure, and food security outcomes.
</p>

<h2>Key Insights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Economic development is strongly associated with improved food availability, but gains vary across regions.</li>
  <li>Environmental pressures such as emissions show complex relationships with food security indicators.</li>
  <li>Higher-income countries exhibit different food security and sustainability trade-offs compared to lower-income countries.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This project demonstrates how integrating economic, environmental,
and food system data can provide a more comprehensive understanding
of global food security challenges and trade-offs.
